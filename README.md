INTRODUCTION

In densely populated areas such as urban environments,
public events, and transportation hubs, monitoring
crowd behavior is paramount for ensuring public safety
and security. Traditional methods of surveillance and
crowd management often rely on manual monitoring,
which can be labor-intensive, time-consuming, and
susceptible to human error. Moreover, as the
complexity and scale of modern urban environments
increase, the need for more sophisticated and efficient
crowd monitoring solutions becomes increasingly
pressing.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The project aims to address the challenge of effectively monitoring crowded
environments by developing a computer vision system capable of
autonomously detecting anomalies in crowd behavior. This involves creating
robust algorithms to analyze live or recorded video feeds, distinguishing
normal crowd patterns from abnormal events such as fights, accidents, or
suspicious behavior, and facilitating timely interventions to ensure public
safety and security.

ABOUT THE DATASET

The mall dataset was collected from a publicly accessible webcam for crowd
counting and profiling research.
Video length: 2000 frames
Frame size: 640x480
Frame rate: < 2 Hz The dataset is composed by RGB images of frames in a
video (as inputs) and the object counting on every frame, this is the
number of pedestrians (object) in the image. The images are 480x640
pixels at 3 channels of the same spot recorded by a webcam in a mall but it
has different number of person on every frame, is a problem of crowd
countinG.
